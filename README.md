# Limbo Loop
## Description
Fight your way though Limbo where each boss brings you closer to freedom and each death sends you back to the beginning, however you keep the skills you learn along the way
This game was made in less than 72 hours by a team of two developers it was both of our first time participating in a game jam 
## Note
We had fun learning new skills in this Jam unfortunately we didnâ€™t get to finish with the scope or functionality that we wanted but we hope you enjoy what we could manage before the deadline!
